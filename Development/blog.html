				<h1>Affects of E-Commerce technolgy in daily life </h1></br>
				<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6">
					<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Electronic commerce (e-commerce) is a business strategy that allows consumers and businesses to buy and sell commodities and services all over the Internet. Not long ago, if you wanted to buy something, you would simply get in your car (or take public transportation) and drive to one of your town's stores. It's now just as natural to open a website at any time of day to buy almost anything you could want.</p>
					
					<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">E-Commerce has had an impact on every aspect of our lives. 
					The internet has altered many areas of life, including how we communicate with one another and manage our finances. It has had a significant impact on society. We now shop online from the comfort of our own homes. This forces retailers to establish an online division. It may also force smaller businesses to close their doors or go entirely online. It has also changed people's spending habits. It will undoubtedly continue to influence how companies sell and market their products, as well as how people make purchasing decisions, for many years to come. Following are some of impacts of E-commerce technology on any business organization:<span id="more-dots">...</span></p>
					<div id="more-text" style="display: none;">
						<strong>• Technology and Organizational Learning: </strong></br>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Rapid advancements in E-Commerce will force businesses to quickly adapt to new technology and provide them with opportunities to experiment with new products, services, and processes. New technologies necessitate new organizational strategies. For example, the structure of the E-Commerce organizational unit may need to differ from that of the traditional sales and marketing departments. New processes must be implemented in order to be more flexible and responsive to the market. This type of corporate transformation must be planned and managed.</p>
						<strong>• Changing Nature of Work: </strong></br>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The nature of work and occupation will change in the Digital Age; this is already happening in front of our eyes. Due to increased competitive environment, businesses are reducing the number of employees to a centre of crucial staff and outsourcing whatever task they can to countries where wages are considerably lower. The upheaval caused by these changes is creating new risks and opportunities, as well as forcing us to reconsider jobs, careers, and salaries. Workers in the Digital Age will need to be extremely adaptable. Few will have truly secure jobs in the traditional sense, and all will need to be capable and willing to constantly learn, make decisions, and stand by them.</p>
						<strong>• Impacts on Manufacturing: </strong></br>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">E-commerce is shifting manufacturing systems away from mass production and toward demand-driven, possibly customized, just-in-time production. In addition, the production systems are linked to finance, advertising, and other functional systems, as well as business partners and customers. Orders taken from customers can be guided to developers and the production floor in seconds using Web-based ERP systems. In many cases, the production cycle time is reduced by 50% or more, particularly when production is done in a different country than where the developers and engineers are located.</p>
						<strong>• Impacts on Finance: </strong></br>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">E-commerce requires specialized financial and accounting systems. For electronic commerce, traditional payment systems are ineffective or inefficient. The use of new payment systems, such as electronic cash, is complicated because it involves legal issues and international standards agreements. Nonetheless, electronic cash is undoubtedly on the way, and it will change the way payments are made. In many ways, electronic cash, which can be backed by currency or other assets, represents the most significant currency revolution since gold replaced cowry shells. Its diversity and pluralism are ideal for the Internet. It has the potential to alter consumers' financial lives as well as shake the foundations of financial systems and even governments.</p>
